# TODO

Add more detailed parsing error messages and corresponding tests.

Add better handling of commas, colons, semicolons, dashes, and other non-word
characters that could appear within a sentence but which aren't words 
themselves.

Return position information along with error strings in a parsing library 
agnostic error type.
